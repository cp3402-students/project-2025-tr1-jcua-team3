## Deployment

This is where we will describe our development and deployment workflow in enough detail that a new team member or someone taking over the project could follow to successfully develop theme updates locally, then test and deploy them to your staging and live sites. This should include aspects such as project management, version control, testing and automation. **Do not provide private details like passwords.**

### Setting up your local environment  #TODO

Once you've set up your own local environment (WAMP, MAMP, XAMP, Docker), download the starter theme from:

> `/project_resources/themes/starter-theme.zip`

Use the theme editor in wordpress to install the starter theme
